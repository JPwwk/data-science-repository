# What Contributes to Social Media Going Viral

This project analyzes post engagement indicators that influence post longevity and reach across platforms. Using `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, it explores post metrics via histograms and descriptive statistics.

## 📊 Objective

To identify key engagement metrics (e.g., likes, retweets, post timing) that drive viral behavior.

## 📁 Dataset

- Social media post dataset with engagement indicators
- Included fields: post time, impressions, likes, shares, platform
- Cleaned and explored using Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` for data wrangling  
- `numpy` for numeric operations  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations

## 📈 Techniques

- Histogram analysis of reach, likes, and comments
- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, range, outlier detection
- Filtering for outliers and high-performing posts

## 🧠 Key Findings

- High-impact posts share common timing windows
- Likes and impressions follow a non-linear pattern
- Outliers disproportionately skew averages, requiring trimming

## 🔗 How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `What_contributes_to_social_media_Going_Viral.ipynb`
2. Run all cells in order
3. Visualizations and results will appear inline

## 📌 Status

Project complete. No additional tuning or modeling applied — focused on EDA and trend isolation.

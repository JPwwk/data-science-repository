# Justin Pizzoferrato ‚Äì Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio, created as part of my graduate work at Bellevue University. This repository includes 10 applied analytics and machine learning projects covering social, environmental, financial, and behavioral topics.

## üéØ Objective

To demonstrate mastery in data science through real-world projects that apply predictive modeling, data visualization, scenario testing, and clustering. Each project is presented with supporting code, explanations, and embedded outputs.

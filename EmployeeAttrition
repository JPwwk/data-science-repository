# Employee Attrition Analysis

This classification model investigates predictors of employee attrition and retention using a Random Forest Classifier. Key libraries include `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict which employees are most likely to leave based on satisfaction, salary, evaluation score, and time spent at the company.

## 📁 Dataset

- HR Analytics dataset with fields such as: satisfaction level, number of projects, average monthly hours, salary level, and whether the employee left
- Cleaned for duplicates and missing values

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization  
- `scikit-learn` for modeling (Random Forest, train/test split, accuracy metrics)

## 📈 Techniques

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmaps and histograms
- RandomForestClassifier with accuracy and feature importance evaluation

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Employees with low satisfaction and high workload are most at risk
- Time at company and number of projects strongly influence attrition
- Salary alone is not a strong predictor

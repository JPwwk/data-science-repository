# Employee Attrition Analysis

This classification model investigates predictors of employee attrition and retention using a Random Forest Classifier. The project identifies the most influential features driving turnover.

## 📊 Objective

To predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on organizational and demographic variables.

## 📁 Dataset

- Synthetic HR dataset with attributes like:
  - Age, department, monthly income, job role
  - Satisfaction level, promotion history, and more

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` for data processing
- `scikit-learn` for modeling and metrics
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

## 🧪 Key Techniques

- Data cleaning and encoding categorical variables
- Train/test split and feature scaling
- Random Forest Classifier model training
- Feature importance extraction
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall

## 📈 Key Outputs

- Visualized feature importances
- Attrition prediction model
- Performance metrics

## 🧭 How to Run

1. Load the dataset and notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Review the performance section and feature importances at the end.

# Childcare Affordability in the U.S.

This project assesses the affordability of childcare across states and income levels using national price and demographic data. It visualizes financial burden and identifies gaps between policy assumptions and real-world access.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore how childcare costs as a percentage of income vary by geography, family composition, and earnings.

## 📁 Datasets

- U.S. Department of Labor Childcare Price Database  
- U.S. Census Median Household Income by State  
- ACS housing cost burden and demographic estimates

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` for data cleaning and transformation  
- `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizations  
- `plotly.express` for interactive mapping

## 🔬 Key Techniques

- Weighted cost vs. unweighted cost comparison  
- Income tier burden analysis  
- Geospatial choropleths  
- Monthly vs. annual breakdowns by state

## 📊 Key Outputs

- Heatmaps of burden by income bracket  
- Choropleths of affordability by state  
- Trendlines showing widening disparity over time

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Load the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code  
2. Run cells to prepare data, normalize, and visualize  
3. Affordability ratios will render in chart and map format

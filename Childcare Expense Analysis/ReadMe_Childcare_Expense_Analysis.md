# Childcare Expense Analysis

This project explores how childcare costs vary by region and time, and how these variations impact household financial burdens. It includes trend evaluation, cost segmentation, and impact forecasting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To identify cost trends, anomalies, and regional differences in childcare expenses over time.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Childcare cost dataset by ZIP code and time.
- Includes monthly costs, care type (infant, toddler), and geographic area.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for trend visualization  
- Time series logic using `groupby`, rolling averages

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

- Cost breakdowns by care type and region
- Time-based trend charts
- Segment analysis of low-, mid-, and high-cost areas

## ðŸ§  Insights

Identifies regions with disproportionately high childcare costs and quantifies time-based shifts. Useful for families, policymakers, and cost-of-living studies.

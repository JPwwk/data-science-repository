# Water Scarcity Forecasting in U.S. Cities

This project models future water usage and scarcity risk in high-growth urban areas. It integrates risk, insurance, and socioeconomic burden into a forecast framework using equity-weighted modeling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To predict long-term water demand and equity risk across Fresno, Houston, and Phoenix based on insurance rates, population growth, and vulnerability indicators.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- FEMA climate declarations
- Census QuickFacts (income, insurance coverage)
- CDC Social Vulnerability Index
- Local per-capita water use records (1980â€“2022)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`
- Regression + scenario forecasting
- Visuals: radar plots, bar charts, projections

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

- Regression coefficients for water use drivers
- Equity Risk Index by city
- Forecast plots through 2050
- Scenario: 10% uninsured rate increase

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

Identifies Fresno as most at-risk for future overuse due to equity-weighted demand growth. Provides data to inform conservation efforts and insurance strategies.

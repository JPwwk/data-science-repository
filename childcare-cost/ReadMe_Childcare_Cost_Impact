# Childcare Cost Impact

This project explores how childcare costs affect U.S. families by income level, using state-level datasets. The analysis highlights affordability challenges and burden disparities.

## 📊 Objective

To evaluate the financial burden of childcare across income groups and geographic locations.

## 📁 Dataset

- U.S. Department of Labor National Database of Childcare Prices (2022)
- Median household income by state
- Family composition data

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` for data wrangling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for plots
- `geopandas` for geospatial mapping

## 🧪 Key Techniques

- Weighted and unweighted average cost analysis
- Affordability ratio calculation
- Time series visualization
- Choropleth maps of childcare burden by state

## 📈 Key Outputs

- Trend charts by income level
- Affordability disparity graphs
- U.S. choropleths of childcare burden

## 🧭 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run cells in order to clean, analyze, and visualize.
3. Geospatial plots will render state-level burden maps.
